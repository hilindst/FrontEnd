Scope, Hoisting and Closures
Hoisting:
Scope:
  Global Variables: can be accessed at any point in time
  Local Variables:  within code blocks {}

  VAR has its own scope rules: can be used globally and in function block, BUT...I don't know, it doesn't work well with scope rules and likes to escape. >shrug<

Closures:
  Function within a Function, access to outer function variables
  :a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them.
